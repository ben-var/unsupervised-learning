# Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction for Bank Marketing and Letter Classification

This repository contains a detailed analysis on two different datasets. The analysis is in the analysis.pdf file.

All the machine learning experiments using unsupervised learning algorithms (i.e., K-means and Expectation Maximization), as well as dimensionality reduction algorithms (i.e., PCA, ICA, etc.) were performed and demonstrated in the core-experiments python notebook. 

Further neural network classification experiments were performed on the clustered, reduced dimensionality data (or a combination of both transformations) to compare and contrast the quality of the clustering with a traditional supervised learning approach.

To use the notebooks in this repo, make sure to use Python3.
